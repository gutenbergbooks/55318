<h3><a name="DION" id="DION"></a><i>DION.</i><br /><br />
A POEM.<br /><br />
<small>ARGUMENT.</small></h3>

<p>Dion, of Syracuse (408-353 B.C.), philosopher, was a near relative,
through his wife Arete, of the tyrant Dionysius the Second, by whom he
was banished. He took up his residence at Athens, but on hearing that
the tyrant had seized his son and given Arete in marriage to another,
with a small and faithful force he returned to Syracuse, captured the
place and drove Dionysius into Ortygia, a fortress within the city
walls. As soon as their oppression was relieved, the suspicious
Syracusans began to fear the power of Dion, although he had nobly
refused to make concessions to Dionysius when urged thereto by the
passionate appeals of Arete and her son, held captive in Ortygia. On
hearing of a plot formed against him among the citizens, by Heracleides,
without taking revenge on the thankless city, Dion withdrew to Leontini,
but only to be speedily recalled to rescue the people a second time from
the ravages of Dionysius, who had charged out upon the town as soon as
Dion had withdrawn. Again Dion returned to Syracuse, and this time
succeeded in routing the tyrant from his stronghold and restoring peace.
With<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>{62}</span> a magnanimity equal to his valour he pardoned Heracleides and his
confreres. On breaking into the deserted fortress at the head of his
troops, Dion, after years of separation, found his wife Arete. Dion
naturally succeeded to the throne of the deposed monarch, but his
reforms and the severity of his manners and rule rendered him unpopular
with his fickle fellow-townsmen, and plots were formed for his
assassination. He scorned to take precautions against attack, and so
fell a victim to his valour. He was surrounded on the day of the
festival of the Koreia, in his apartment in the palace, by a band of
youths of distinguished muscular strength, who endeavoured to throw and
strangle him. But the old warrior proving too strong for them, they were
obliged to send out one of their number through a back door to procure a
sword. With this, Dion, a man in many ways too great for his age and
circumstances, was despatched.</p>

<span class="i0">Like the choir-master’s baton when hushing the singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the tongue of the bell when its tollings subside.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It lit up the poor paper flowers on the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And odd were the shadows it scattered around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On pulpit and lectern, on choir-seat and psalter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While the chains threw the ghost of a cross on the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>{97}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The people at home in their cabins were sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The curé was tucked in his four-posted bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While under the willows the river was creeping<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if silent with fear of the wind overhead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the little dark church had its own congregation&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shadows that swayed on the pews and the floor&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the rafters that creaked were a choir whose laudation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had an organ for base in the hurricane’s roar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rusty gilt cock on the flèche was the preacher,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And scolding and grumpy his voice was to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he turned to the storm like some faithful old teacher<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who prophesies hard things regardless of fear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the service reflected the state of the weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For though each, I must say, did his part with a will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preacher and choir spoke and sang all together,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the shapes on the benches would never sit still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>{98}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet there was the Host, in the midst of the altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where that little red curtain of damask was hung,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God whom King David has praised in the psalter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to whom the whole choir of the ages has sung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But so big is the heart of our God, the Life-giver,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in it life’s humour and pathos both meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I doubt not that night in the church by the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The poor old storm’s service to Him sounded sweet.<br /></span>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
